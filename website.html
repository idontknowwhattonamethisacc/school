        <h1>THIS GAME</h1>
        <p>Echoes of a dark and violent past resonate throughout a savage land, steeped in treasure and blood. Hyper Light Drifter is an action adventure RPG in the vein of the best 16­bit classics, with modernized mechanics and designs on a much grander scale.<br><br>

            Drifters of this world are the collectors of forgotten knowledge, lost technologies and broken histories. Our Drifter is haunted by an insatiable illness, traveling further into the lands of Buried Time, hoping to discover a way to quiet the vicious disease.<br><br>
            
            • From each character to subtle background elements, everything is lovingly hand-animated.<br>
            • Easy to pick up, difficult to master; enemies are vicious and numerous, hazards will easily crush your frail body, and friendly faces remain rare.<br>
            • Upgrade weapons, learn new skills, discover equipment and traverse a dark, detailed world with branching paths and secrets abound.<br></p>

        <h1>WELCOME</h1>
        <p>Hyper Light Drifter is a 2D action role-playing game developed by Heart Machine. 
            The game pays homage to 8-bit and 16-bit games, and is considered by its lead 
            developer Alx Preston as a combination of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past 
            and Diablo. Preston originally launched Kickstarter funding for the title for approximately 
            US$27,000 to develop the title for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux computers, but ended 
            up with more than US$600,000, allowing him to hire more programmers and artists, and 
            expanding the title for console and portable platforms through stretch goals. Though 
            originally scoped for release in 2014, various improvements in the game and issues with 
            Preston's health set the release back. The Microsoft Windows, Linux and OS X versions were 
            released in March 2016, and the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions in July 2016. A Special 
            Edition port of the game, featuring additional content, was released by Abylight Studios for 
            the Nintendo Switch in September 2018 and for iOS devices in July 2019</p>
